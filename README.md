# Christian Burk's Management README

The development of culture is perhaps the most important responsibility of any leader of an organization. Moreover, leadership is not a function of a role or title. Hense, everyone's primary concern should be whether what we are doing today and how we are doing it will enhance our ability to achieve our goals or whether it will undermine that effort. We are tasked with the stewardship of other people's resources, their ideas, their creativity, their time and their money. That we are given charge over some small piece of a large endeavor that cannot be accomplished through the work of one person alone requires that we consider the others who toil with us and add their efforts to our own.   

Feedback should be as immediate as possible
- it should be whenever something stands out, either when you see room for improvement or when you "catch people doing something right."
- it should always be prefaced with something like, "Do you have time for some feedback?" This enables the other person to better understand the pretext for your discusion and determine whether this is the right time or whether another time would be more conducive to a constructive conversation

People should know as much as can be shared and be allowed to determine

Knowledge should be shared as a renewable resource which multiplies in its benefit when it moves from one to many. The single person's idea or discovery can gain legs (and fur and a tail--if it's a puppy) when it becomes community property, rather than someone's secret.

Knowledge should be accessible.

We should have an open dialogue. 

I should not be the only person or even the first person, necessarily, who knows of conflicts within a team.

Care should be taken to be curious first, and always, before dismissing someone's thought. The best, most original ideas often sound absurd when they are first proposed.

Who we bring to the team should be someone you would love to work with. 

I want people to feel fulfilled by the work they do here.

People should be real with each other and with me. I will try to be so with them.

You can cry when we talk. It happens. We put a lot of ourselves into our jobs. Plus, our sense of security is usually wrapped up in the continuation of our job or the promotion to another, so the quality of someone's work feels existential, espeically when the job is under threat. 

I want to know you first. I'll hold regularly scheduled 1-on-1s for that purpose, typically one per sprint. I am open and welcome impromptu discussions as they are needed, though, to supplement what we share in 1-on-1s. The purpose is to give you a platform to discuss your concerns, whether they be about specific work or more generally about you and your role in the team. I will want to know how I can support you, what interventions I can make on your behalf, for instance. I'll also take the time to review items we discussed previously to see what progress has been made.

I believe we should hire the right people for the job. That does not always mean the super star. I am looking for what size hole the team perceives and someone who can fit into the space and then start changing it. I have never been anywhere in which people have demonstrated their capabilities have not been able to shape their position in relation to what they perceive is needed by the company and by their professional growth goals.
