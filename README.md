# Christian Burk's Manager README

## Checking my privilege (a disclaimer)
Two facts have not altered throughout my adult life: I am white and male. These facts distort reality around me with a bubble of privilege that I try to recognize and question even as they alter what I perceive and how I am perceived. Privilege is easy to see during a traffic stop or job opportunity, but mostly it is as water to fish: invisible and noticeable only in its absence. When I encounter information that do not conform to what I "know," I investigate it and the assumptions that accompany my privilege so that my analysis is not unduly affected by whiteness or maleness. I often describe my thought process where my privilege and the world meet in the interest of full disclosure. 

## How I talk
My externalized thought processing on many topics can produce a lot of words. It's not always because I have a lot to say but that I tend to verbalize my exploration of ideas or experiences to better understand them. Thus, in trying to express my thoughts accurately, I sometimes sacrifice focus and clarity for comprehensiveness and transparency. Years of studying English and working in marketing and PR have encouraged brevity and pacing. I have learned that 1) not every thought of mine is brilliant and worth sharing and 2) silence has value. 

## How we should talk
Silence is actually an invitation for the rest of the world speak. This is particularly important when I am with you. You are the most important truth to me when we are together, and I will let silence give us room for our thoughts and your words. That does not mean I will always understand you or you, me. That's what questions are for. I hope you ask a lot of questions. I know I'm going to. I see questions as tools for investigating an organization, a relationship, or even our thoughts about the world, our work, or each other. 

## When we should talk
To get to know you and work with you, I hold regularly scheduled one-on-one meetings, typically one per two-week sprint and 45 minutes to one hour in length. The purpose is to give you a platform to discuss your concerns, whether they be about specific work or more generally about you and your role in the team. I will want to know how I can support you. I will also take the time to review items we discussed previously to see what has changed. Lastly, I want to look ahead for opportunities that interest you and allow you to consider the future you imagine for yourself and how we can combine our efforts to achieve that.

## Real talk
Outside of the one-on-ones, I welcome impromptu discussions as they are needed to supplement what we share in one-on-ones. Sometimes those conversations will involve feedback. When something stands out, either when you see room for improvement or when you "catch people doing something right" it's important to point that out. I will provide that to you, and I would ask that you provide that to me. Preferably, it is prefaced with something like, "Is this a good time for some feedback?" This enables the other person to better understand the pretext for the discusion and determine whether this is the right time or whether another time would be better.

## At the center of everything
All of this talk presumes honesty on my part and yours, which I value above everything else. Kindness comes a close second. I do not believe that they have to be exclusive to each other, either. In fact, I would be the president of the diplomacy fanclub if I knew how to join, as I believe that the right message can make a point without making an enemy. I believe in the inherent goodness of people that can be better tapped by working with them and wanting what is best for them. That does not mean sugarcoating as much as contextualizing information to make sure that it is seen in its proper light. After all, how we do things, not just what we do, defines our culture.

## Let's keep it up
The development of culture is perhaps the most important responsibility of any leader of an organization. Really, everyone's primary concern should be whether what we are doing today and how we are doing it will enhance our ability to achieve our goals or whether it will undermine that effort. We are tasked with the stewardship of other people's resources, their ideas, their creativity, their time, and their money. We are given charge over some small piece of a large endeavor that we cannot accomplished alone. This requires that we consider the others who toil with us. We have immediate work to do in accomplishing sprint goals, but how we do it should allows us to keep doing it over and over again with better results, faster turn around, and more enjoyment. It's like a farmer whose day-to-day concern is the production of food but whose long-term and overriding goal is the perpetuation of arable land, capable of sustaining life and growing crops for the next generation.

## Give it a try
To keep up that sustainable momentum, I have found that trying something is better than debating it, especially if it is a matter of minutes or a couple hours. I have seen debates between senior developers persist for days and sometimes weeks about a change that would be demonstrated in just a few hours. Those debates were not only acrimonious for the participants, but they also cast a pall over the other more junior members of the team, who, like me, thought the disagreement could be resolved through the coding up the proposed solutions and showing the team to get their feedback.

## Harder, better, faster, stronger
A similar focus on efficiency in working habits at the indivual and team level are critical to success. Tools, habits and systems that maximize efficiency and effectiveness are welcomed and encouraged. For instance, I've been using Evernote for keeping my notes for nearly a decade.  Besides review and retrieval, the act of recording itself is an aid to memory. The more a team can capture its own thoughts in a similar place that makes it easy to share and find, the better the overal team. Other tools or habits that make better code, reduce build times, or allow for easier debugging are welcome, to name a few examples. I encourage you to either share with me or your colleagues your work-optimizing techniques, as I share my own with you and/or encourage you to find or develop your own. 

## Change makes sense (dad joke)
Nevertheless, any process for doing work is imperfect and should be subject to change, just like this README. Given that I have changed in the past, I will likely change in the future. It may even change because of interactions and knowledge gained or created while interacting with you. You will challenge me to question my assumptions, conclusions and habits and cause me to adjust myself accordingly. That is the nature of impactful relationships and interactions. Conversely, this document may change not even because I have changed so much as because my ability to articulate the who, what and why of myself will have improved with a greater self-awareness or through a more faithful rendition of that awareness. This is not the final word about me as a manager. Like any scientific knowledge, it is the best model to fit the evidence I have today.
