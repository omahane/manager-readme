# Christian Burk's Management README

## Who am I?
"I’m the Dude. So that’s what you call me. You know, that or, uh, His Dudeness, or uh, Duder, or El Duderino if you’re not into the whole brevity thing.” - The Dude

"So I pointed my fingers
And shouted few quotes I knew
As if something that's written
Should be taken as true"
Taylor Goldsmith for Dawes

I have a tendency to want quote famous people, leaning on their fame to lend credibility to my points. But also to make it clear that so many of the things I think or have learned have been learned from elsewhere. Even though that is not exactly true. It's just that what I have read or heard that has resonated most with me are those statements that fit the evidence of my own first-hand experience. Plus, using other people's words to emphasize your points is like making Christmas cookies by coating in chocolate two Ritz crackers with peanut sandwiched between them. It's the combination of all these pre-made parts that goes so well together. Like Jason Derulo using the "Hide and Seek" sample by Imogene Heap in 'Watcha Say."

First, human. And a student of the humanities before I was a technologist. That may be why I approach my work more as a person first in relation to another person.

You are the most important thing to me when I am with you. It could be that you and I have entirely different backgrounds with no apparent similarities, but I will find you fascinating, nonetheless. Strangeness is no crime and no problem. That does not mean I will always understand you or you, me. Sometimes, we will be opaque conundrums to each other. That's what questions are for. I hope you ask a lot of questions. I know I'm going to. I will ask questions of you, too. As somone who studied language before technology (and wrote many papers on a manual typewriter), I see questions as tools for investigating the system of an organization, a relationship or even the way you and I think about the world, our work or each other. 

## What do I value?
More than anything else, I value honesty. After that, kindness. I don't believe that they have to be exclusive to each other. In fact, I would probably be the president of the diplomacy fanclub if I knew how to join, as I believe that the right message can make a point without making an enemy. I believe in the inherent goodness of people that can be better tapped by working with them and wanting what is best for them. That does not mean sugarcoating as much as contextualizing information to make sure that it is seen in its proper light.

People do not want to be valued only for what they can do. They want first to be valued for who they are. After all, who they are preceded what they do as their capabilities developed and grew and will likely succeed what they can do as their capabilities wane. Who they are is the core issue. I believe if people know best who they are they will better perform in what they do. I want people to get lost in the world of thought but also to have a beacon that others can activate to bring them back home. 



This interaction makes me think that I value introspection and self-improvement greatly. Know yourself well. Check in with yourself. 

I want to praise good work and good efforts and regret that I do not do it enough. 

I want to give you attention.

The ability of an organization to continue to play.

I believe in play. (I used to work at a children's museum). I want to joke around, break through mental blocks, allow people to let their guards down and share a laugh. Sometimes it is critical to getting past a difficult task or moment, to simply not take it all too seriously--including yourself. In the book The Dude and the Zen Master, Bernie Glassman talks about taking a moment in the beginning of each day and laughing at yourself in the mirror. In part, laughter releases a unique set of hormones that benefit the body. Additionally, when you laugh at yourself, you cannot take yourself too seriously, which means that everything you do and say will be against the backdrop of that daily humbling laugh. It makes working with others, especially when they don't agree with you, much easier. It makes working with yourself easier, too, because even in your most stressful moments, you can recall that self-generated and self-directed laughter. There's a joy in it that surpasses momentary vicissitudes.

The development of culture is perhaps the most important responsibility of any leader of an organization. Moreover, leadership is not a function of a role or title. Hense, everyone's primary concern should be whether what we are doing today and how we are doing it will enhance our ability to achieve our goals or whether it will undermine that effort. We are tasked with the stewardship of other people's resources, their ideas, their creativity, their time, and their money. We are given charge over some small piece of a large endeavor that cannot be accomplished through the work of one person. This stewardship requires that we consider the others who toil with us and add their efforts to our own. We have immediate work to do in accomplishing sprint goals, but we have to do it in such a way that we can keep doing it over and over again with better results, faster turn around, and more enjoyment. It's like a farmer whose day-to-day concern is the production of food but whose long-term and overriding goal is the perpetuation of arable land, capable of sustaining life and growing crops for the next generation.

Feedback should be as immediate as possible
- it should be whenever something stands out, either when you see room for improvement or when you "catch people doing something right."
- it should always be prefaced with something like, "Do you have time for some feedback?" This enables the other person to better understand the pretext for your discusion and determine whether this is the right time or whether another time would be more conducive to a constructive conversation

People should know as much as can be shared and be allowed to determine

Knowledge should be accessible.

We should have an open dialogue. 

I should not be the only person or even the first person, necessarily, who knows of conflicts within a team.

Care should be taken to be curious first, and always, before dismissing someone's thought. The best, most original ideas often sound absurd when they are first proposed.

Who we bring to the team should be someone you would love to work with. 

I want people to feel fulfilled by the work they do here.

People should be real with each other and with me. I will try to be so with them.

Emotions are healthy and keep us sane. If you did not find yourself emotionally affected by what was happening around you, then it's possible you are not fully engaged in the effort. We freight our work with our own personality and ideas, so it is natural to find things frustrating, sometimes so much so that you want to cry. That expression of emotion is perfectly appropriate when we are talking together in our one-on-ones. It happens. We put a lot of ourselves into our jobs. Plus, our sense of security is usually wrapped up in the continuation of our job or the promotion to another, so the quality of someone's work feels existential, espeically when the job is under threat. Extreme emotions help us processes the extremes of human experience, some of which are a part of work. After all, we spend a lot of our waking hours working, so it is likely that have a lot of feelings about what we are doing and what is happening to us.

I want to know you first. I'll hold regularly scheduled one-on-one meetings for that purpose, typically one per sprint and 45 minutes to one hour in length. I am open and welcome impromptu discussions as they are needed, though, to supplement what we share in one-on-ones. The purpose is to give you a platform to discuss your concerns, whether they be about specific work or more generally about you and your role in the team. I will want to know how I can support you, what interventions I can make on your behalf, for instance. I will also take the time to review items we discussed previously to see what progress has been made. I also want to use that time to look ahead for opportunities that interest you and allow you to consider the future you imagine for yourself and how we can combine our efforts to achieve that.

I believe we should hire the right people for the job. That does not always mean the super star. I am looking for what size hole the team perceives and someone who can fit into the space and then start changing it. I have never been anywhere in which people have demonstrated their capabilities have not been able to shape their position in relation to what they perceive is needed by the company and by their professional growth goals.

I listen first for understanding. My daughter was saying the other day that history is not well taught in her school and that she wished it better mapped to people's experience in the world. She noticed that when you start thinking of history of what happened according to a certain perspective that world becomes a lot more interesting and multi-faceted. When I am talking to someone, I want to understand how they see the world and their experience in it. I may not see it as they do, but before I identify the areas where we likely disagree, I want to know where they are coming from. It is possible we see things similarly but express it differently or that we see see things the same way under certain circumstances but not all. Lastly, we may not see things the same way but if I understand their perspective, I can determine whether I need to adjust mine, they theirs or we need to both come to a new understanding. In fact, to me, that is the true purpose of a meeting: to create meaning that could not have existed without the perspective of more than one person coming together and finding something neither of them could readily find on their own. It's like a Reese's Peanut Butter cup: two great tastes that taste great together.

How I like to work

Trying something is better than debating it, especially if it is a matter of minutes or a couple hours. I have seen debates between senior developers persist for days and sometimes weeks about a change that would be demonstrated in just a few hours. Those debates were not only acrimonious for the participants, but they also cast a pall over the other more junior members of the team, who, like me, thought the disagreement could be resolved through the coding up the proposed solutions and showing the team to get their feedback.

While I do not want to rush relationship building, I think efficiency in working habits at the indivual and team level are critical to success. Tools, habits and systems that maximize efficiency are welcomed and encouraged. For instance, I've been using Evernote for keeping my notes for nearly a decade. It is the one place I know they live. First, it encourages that I take notes because I have a place for them to be stored for retrieval and review, reducing some of that decision fatigue. Secondly, because I take notes, I remember better what happened, what was discussed or what I thought because I recorded it. The act of recording itself is an aid to memory. The more a team can capture its own thoughts in a similar place that makes it easy to share and find, the better the overal team. Hal Holbrook, who for many years would play Mark Twain on stage, talked in an interview about his love of sailing. He would often sail solo on the ocean. He said that the key to being safe while being out in the middle of the ocean by yourself was that you always knew where all of your tools were. "The knife goes in the same place every time," as he said.
I will likely encourage you to either share with me or your colleagues your work-optimizing techniques, share my own with you and/or encourage you to find or develop your own. 

I recently had a conversation with a senior developer. We were talking about how he prepares for sprint refinement and why he does not always do so. He mentioned that he sometimes loses track of time while working. I began to ask how he organizes his time and day. He responded that he did not really have a way to organize his day. I asked about scheduling tasks on a calendar or writing down a list of "to do" items. I asked if he used any tools to keep track of work. "No, not really." The problem was that he was not as productive, organized, or responsible as he should be in his role. Despite that, he had not endeavored to better manage his time and attention. 

I value consitency and reliability, both of which can be indicative of integrity. I want my words and my actions to be well aligned and look for colleagues at work to be similarly aligned. If I say that I intend to do something and commit to it, I am going to take the steps necessary to maximize the likelihood of doing what I said I would do. I will also follow up about the status of that commitment, so that all of the interested and informed parties are aware of the current status. 



## Change gonna come
Recently, I apologized to a person who reported to me, a person who most of the development team thinks of as a junior developer. We were having a one-on-one, and she asked me to compare her with another developer to explain why she is considered a junior developer but the other person is not. I described the difference in their education and different jobs before coming to their development positions. She pointed out that I missed a key portion of her experience that directly preceded her current job. I admitted that I had, in fact, forgot to consider her work in data engineering and SQL report development and apologized. It was humbling but was not the first time that I have had a blindspot illuminated for me. This occasional (and sometimes frequent) admonishment keeps me honest, and I am so happy to know that people have the 

While I believe that much of the description above is both accurate and central to who I am as a manager, some of it has not always been so. Given that I have changed in the past, I will likely change in the future. It may even change because of interactions and knowledge gained or created while interacting with the readers of this document. They may challenge me to question my assumptions, conclusions and habits and cause me to adjust myself accordingly. That is the nature of impactful relationships and interactions. Conversely, this document may change not even because I have changed so much as because my ability to articulate the who, what and why of myself will have improved with a greater self-awareness or through a more faithful rendition of that awareness. In any case, this is not the final word and testimony about me as a manager. Like any scientific knowledge, it is the best model to fit the evidence I have today.
